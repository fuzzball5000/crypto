# crypto

A little while ago, I undertook a well known (I won't name them, but if you're reading this your probably know...) series of Crypto challenges.

Shortly after I started, the project became over-subscribed, and I kinda forgot about it until recently. I'm glad to say, it's back, and more open than before, so I intend to pick up where I left off. 

Here's some of my solutions to the first set. Usual disclaimers: they're my solutions, yours will vary. Sharing them because I found them interesting. Copy them and you'll learn nothing etc etc.
